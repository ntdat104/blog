# Using TypeScript Intersections to extend component's props in React

## 1. Every app has buttons.

So, let's create a Button component, which uses the button html element under the hood.

```tsx
export default function Button({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <button className="btn">{children}</button>;
}
```

Easy peasy.

But in terms of functionality, our button is very limited. For example, having this implementation, we cannot handle any events, cannot extend the `className`, nor pass any `style`, `disabled`, etc. props to it. It's basically a very dumb component.

There are several possible approaches we can take in order to make it a useful one.

## 2. Props "babysitting" or any type

One way to do it is by "babysitting" every possible button property there is by ourselves. Like this:

```tsx
export default function Button({
  children,
  onClick,
  style,
  disabled,
  // ... etc.
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  onClick: (e: MouseEvent) => void }
  style: { [key: string]: any
  disabled: boolean
  // ... etc.
}) {
  return (
    <button
      className="btn"
      onClick={onClick}
      style={style}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

We can list all of native `button`'s properties in our `Button`' s props, or some of them, but that's very tedious and far from scalable.

Another option is to use the `any` type and tell TypeScript that our component doesn't care about what types are the props it receives. I'm not going into details here, because `any` defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place. And on top of that, using it is a strong sign for being lazy and we're not lazy. :)

So, there's a smarter approach.

## 3. Using `...rest` with TypeScript's intersections.

```tsx
export default function Button({
  children,
  ...rest
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button">) {
  return (
    <button className="btn" {...rest}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Using the JavaScript's `...rest` operator, we collect every possible property the user of the component passes to it in an array, called `rest`.

After that we "spread" the array in the `<button>`, making our Button component act as a "proxy".

One thing that's important to notice is the intersection type `{ ... }` & `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'>`.

This is how we tell TypeScript that our Button component may receive any of the native button's properties through the `...rest`.

Sweet. We are happy. TypeScript is happy. ðŸŽ‰

But we're not constrained only to extending props using only native HTML elements. We can do it with custom ones, too.

Here's an example, where we create an `IconButton`, which composes our `Button` component, but adds the ability to display an icon, next to the button's content. Notice that in this case we should use `typeof Component` to indicate that we're using a custom one.

```tsx
export default function IconButton({
  icon,
  children,
  ...rest
}: {
  icon: React.ReactNode;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Button>) {
  return (
    <Button {...rest}>
      <Icon name="add" />
      {children}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## 4. Conclusion

Use `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<type>` with intersections to compose custom component types. Forget about `any` and props "babysitting". Be smart and reuse whenever possible, whatever possible.
